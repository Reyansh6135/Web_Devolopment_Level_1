  <p>Generally when you do something wrong in code, there are two main
types of error that you'll come across:
● Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually
cause the program not to run, like the Rust error shown above. These
are usually easy to fix as long as you are familiar with the language's
syntax and know what the error messages mean.
● Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct,
but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that the
program runs incorrectly. These are often harder to fix than syntax
errors, as there isn't an error message to direct you to the source of
the error.</p>  <br> <br>
<p>
    HTML itself doesn't suffer from syntax errors because browsers parse it
    permissively, meaning that the page still displays even if there are syntax
    errors. Browsers have built-in rules to state how to interpret incorrectly
    written markup, so you'll get something running, even if it is not what you
    expected. This, of course, can still be a problem!
    Now how to solve these issues we should debug our code: <br>
    1. Check all your syntax.<br>
    2. Check whether all the tags are opened or closed properly or not, when
    we use VS Code or Sublime its color combination scheme helps us to
    find errors <br>
    3. Check the CSS is applied to correct tag <br>
    4. Check that the CSS is not taken over by any other CSS properties<br>
    5. If no CSS is coming check whether file is linked or not.<br>
    6. Use Inspect Mode of browser to check all the code using Ctrl+Shift+I
    or right mouse click then select inspect.<br>
    7. Check sources section to look which files are linked with that HTML
    file..<br>
    8. Tell the student that for debugging we use the console window in
    inspect mode.<br>
