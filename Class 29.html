1. JS Functions:
● JavaScript functions are used to perform operations. We can call
JavaScript functions many times to reuse the code.
● There are mainly two advantages of JavaScript functions:
★ Code reusability: We can call a function several times so it saves
coding.
★ Less coding: It makes our program compact. We don’t need to write
many lines of code each time to perform a common task.


2. Javascript Events:
● When javascript code is included in HTML, javascript reacts over these
events and allows the execution. This process of reacting over the events
is called Event Handling.
● Events are listed below with their event handlers and
working:-
1. Event: click
Event Handler: onclick
Description: When mouse click on an element
2. Event: load
Event Handler: onload
Description: When the browser finishes the loading of the page
3. Event: submit
Event Handler: onsubmit
Description: When user submits the form
